## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I chose the topic of anime recommendations as I am curious to find out whether my belief that the recommendations will be based primarily on the number of episodes/time investment required to catch up (so enjoyment is only a secondary factor) is accurate and, if it's not, what are the common trends that lead to certain shows getting recommended more than others. A secondary, more selfish goal I have with this project is to help filter my own watchlist so that I can better understand how to dodge the shows that somehow fall into the recommended list despite my lack of interest in either the genre or the story structure. In regards to being required to create a Dashboard for this project I am more than confident I will be able to construct an informative dashboard that can potentially even help others in learning how to better filter their recommendations so that they don’t waste time on shows they have no interest in.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

I found the dataset “Anime Recommendations Database” on Kaggle where it had been submitted by CooperUnion. The data contains 2 .csv files:
1: anime.csv which focuses more on the anime itself containing 7 different columns providing each row entry with a name, an anime_id, a genre(s), a type (Ex. Episode vs OVA or Movie), the number of episodes, the rating given by users on myanimelist.net, as well as the number of community members that fall into this anime’s “group”.
2: rating.csv which focuses more on the individual containing 3 columns providing user_id, anime_id, and rating The data was published to Kaggle 4 years ago now however I believe that the trends found back then will still line up with today’s recommendations and ratings. The purpose of this data set was to “Build a better anime recommendation system based only on user viewing history”. The publisher states that the anime data and user ratings were provided by myanimelist.net API.
